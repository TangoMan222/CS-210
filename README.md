PROMPT:
Update the README file in your repository and include your answers to each of the questions below, using the sub-bullets to help guide your thoughts.
You could include the questions and write a few sentences in response to each one, or you could write a paragraph or two weaving together all of your answers.

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This programs goal was to print out a chart that the balance of an account over a set amount of years based on the following:
initial investment, monthly deposit, annual interest, and number of years

2. What did you do particularly well?

I believe I implemented a very clean main method that leads to a file that is easy to read as well as understand.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

One way I believe I could enhance my code is by implementing a better method to catch wxemptions and preventing users from entering unfavorable input.
for example entering a million years for the time period

4.Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging code to write was probably the interest and monthly deposit calculation and ensuring that it is correctly calculating the correct values.
I overcame this by taking my time and diligently reviewing my code and the formula provided in the guidelines.

5.What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The mathematics used are able to be used in a large amount of other projects from video games to data science and AI.

6.How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

By keeping my main method compact and broken down into a couple methods allows for greater readability and easier future implementaion of updates.
